# Time-Series-Project---App-Average-Usage-Forecasting

Abstract:
This project is a full analysis of a dataset “AppData.Rdata”, which contains averages of daily data usage (MB) of 9 categories (namely App i, for i = 1, . . . , 9) of mobile apps of a mobile carrier operating in Chengdu, Sichuan. The data spans December 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020, during which the city government imposed three levels of public health restrictions: Policy-level 1, starting January 25, when households were limited to daily grocery trips; Policy-level 2, starting February 26, when most mobility restrictions were lifted; Policy-level 3, starting March 25, when all restrictions were lifted. 
The goal of this project is to forecast the average usage starting from Mar 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020. xs,i is the true average of data usage of App i on Day s and xˆs,i is my forecast. The accuracy of forecast is decided by the mean squared errors, which need to be minimized:
